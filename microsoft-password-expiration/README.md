Numerous characteristics of them email raise suspicions over it:

### Flag 1

![Flag 1](https://github.com/SeanWrightSec/phishing-examples/blob/main/microsoft-password-expiration/flag-1.png)

The "Microsoft" logo is certainly not the legitimate logo. The official Microsfot logo is shown below:

As can be seen, firstly the colours of the logo do not match, especially the windows part of the logo. Secondly the wording of Microsoft on the official logo does not overlap the windows logo.

### Flag 2

The punctuation of the name is incorrect, it should start with an upper case. This points to possibility of them using the username instead of fullname of the "employee". IT departments will hardly ever address employees using their username, instead using the employee's actual name.

### Flag 3

The punctuation on 'Password' is incorrect, it should be a lower case 'p'.

### Flag 4

The last glaringly obvious flag is the ability to keep the same password. This will never happen should your password expire! This entirely defeats the whole purpose of you password expiring. Those behind this email are playing the fact that users do not want to chagne their passwords periodically and instead prefer to keep their same password.
